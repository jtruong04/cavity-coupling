  abstract = {The interaction of qubits via microwave frequency photons enables long-distance qubit-qubit coupling and facilitates the realization of a large-scale quantum processor. However, qubits based on electron spins in semiconductor quantum dots have proven challenging to couple to microwave photons. In this theoretical work we show that a sizable coupling for a single electron spin is possible via spin-charge hybridization using a magnetic field gradient in a silicon double quantum dot. Based on parameters already shown in recent experiments, we predict optimal working points to achieve a coherent spin-photon coupling, an essential ingredient for the generation of long-range entanglement. Furthermore, we employ input-output theory to identify observable signatures of spin-photon coupling in the cavity output field, which may provide guidance to the experimental search for strong coupling in such spin-photon systems and opens the way to cavity-based readout of the spin qubit.},

  abstract = {Microfabricated superconducting circuit elements can harness the power of quantum behaviour for information processing. Unlike classical information bits, quantum information bits (qubits) can form superpositions or mixture states of ON and OFF, offering a faster, natural form of parallel processing. Previously, direct qubitâ€“qubit coupling has been achieved for up to four qubits, but now two independent groups demonstrate the next crucial step: communication and exchange of quantum information between two superconducting qubits via a quantum bus, in the form of a resonant cavity formed by a superconducting transmission line a few millimetres long. Using this microwave cavity it is possible to store, transfer and exchange quantum information between two quantum bits. It can also perform multiplexed qubit readout. This basic architecture lends itself to expansion, offering the possibility for the coherent interaction of many superconducting qubits. The cover illustrates a zig-zag-shaped resonant cavity or quantum bus linking two superconducting phase qubits.},
